# C++ package that is meant for calculating simple algebra
## ::::: DOCUMENTATIONS :::::
- Vector
    - Does simple algebra (add, subtract, and multiply with scalas) with vector
    - Handles vector with int, double, and float
        - all data types of parameters within a vector must match
- Matrix
    - Does simple algebra (add, subtract, and multiplication with scalas, vector, matrices) with matrix
    - Handles matrix with int, double, and float
        - all data types of parameters within a matrix must match
